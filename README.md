iOS Cache

## Save cache using CoreData and SQLite

1) SQLite:

	- SQLite is, as advertised, lightweight.
	- SQLite uses less memory and storage space.
	- SQLite can be tedious and error-prone to code.
	- SQLite is supported on Android and Microsoft Windows Phone.

2) Core Data

	- Longer learning curve: it takes some study to understand.
	- Objects are easier to work with.
	- Underlying storage details are handled atomically (support for iCloud).
	- Undo and Redo features.

Core Data Stack: NSManagedObjectModel, NSPersistentStoreCoordinator, NSManagedObjectContext

3) App Extensions

Requires: iOS 8, OS X Yosemite
